# Random Color Theme for VS Code

> **⚠️ Sensitivity Warning:** This extension alters the color theme of your IDE frequently and randomly. If you are sensitive to rapid visual changes or have specific visual requirements, please consider this before installation.


Bring a splash of spontaneity and chaos to your coding environment with the Random Color Theme extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension generates a new, randomly colored theme for your IDE **every 4 minutes and 20 seconds**, keeping your workspace fresh and exciting. Say goodbye to the monotony of static themes and welcome a dynamic burst of color that changes as you work.

You're liking the current colors? Hit the save button in the status bar to save and make your own theme out of it!

> **Please note:** This extension generates a new theme randomly and frequently. While it adds an element of surprise and fun, you might occasionally encounter a theme that doesn't suit your preferences (or isn't readable at all). But don't worry, just wait a bit and a new theme will be generated!

## Features

- **Random Color Generation**: Enjoy a unique color scheme generated randomly every 4 minutes and 20 seconds.
- **Theme Saving**: Found a color theme you love? Easily save it with a single click for future use.
- **Custom Color Keys**: Utilizes a comprehensive list of color keys to ensure a wide variety of colors across different parts of the IDE.
- **Simple to Use**: With minimal configuration required, you can start enjoying random color themes right away.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Extension**: Search for "Random Color Theme" in the VS Code Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS) and click Install.
2. **Enjoy Automatic Theme Changes**: Once installed, the extension will automatically start generating and applying new color themes every 4 minutes and 20 seconds.
3. **Save Your Favorite Themes**: Use the "Save Current Theme" command in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) or click the "Save Current Theme" button in the status bar to save any theme that catches your eye.
4. **Access Your Saved Themes**: Open the Command Palette and run "Open Saved Themes Folder" to explore your saved themes.

## Commands

- **Save Current Theme (`randomColorTheme.saveCurrentTheme`)**: Saves the currently applied random color theme for later use. Access this command via the status bar item marked `Save Current Theme` or through the Command Palette.
- **Open Saved Themes Folder (`randomColorTheme.openSavedThemesFolder`)**: Opens the folder where your saved themes are stored, allowing you to easily manage and apply your favorite themes.

## How It Works

The extension uses a predefined list of color keys to generate a new theme by assigning random colors to each key. These color schemes are applied directly to your VS Code environment, transforming your workspace with vibrant colors.

## Customization

Found a set of colors you particularly enjoy? The saved themes are stored in your workspace under the `your-random-themes` directory, allowing you to revisit and apply your favorite themes anytime.
